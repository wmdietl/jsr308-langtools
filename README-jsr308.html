<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>
(If you are impatient, you can skip to the
<a href="#installing">installation instructions</a>.)
</p>

<p>
The Type Annotations compiler is a version of the OpenJDK Java 7 compiler
that supports some <a href="#openjdk-differences"><b>extra features</b></a>
for type annotations.
Since build
<a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk7/milestones/">M4</a>, the
OpenJDK Java 7 compiler has supported the Type Annotations (JSR 308)
syntax, which permits annotations to appear on
types.  The extra features in the Type Annotations compiler
make it possible for you write (and type-check) type annotations, while
still permitting your code to be compiled with a Java 4/5/6 compiler.
</p>



<p>
You may use the Type Annotations compiler as a replacement for the
<a href="http://openjdk.java.net/groups/compiler/">OpenJDK <code>javac</code> compiler</a> or any other Java compiler.
<!--
, and you may use the JSR 308 <code>javap</code> tool
serves as a drop-in replacement for the OpenJDK <code>javap</code> tool,
and it can optionally disassemble both <a
href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=175">JSR 175</a> and JSR 308
annotations.
-->
</p>

<p>
Pluggable type-checking is made <em>possible</em> by the Type Annotations
syntax.  Pluggable type-checking is made <em>easy</em> by the 
<a href="http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/">Checker
Framework</a>.  It includes several example type qualifiers that you can
start using right away, and it enables you to create your own new compiler
plug-ins that check user-defined type qualifiers.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="#installing">&ldquo;Installing the Type Annotations
compiler&rdquo;</a> section below contains
instructions for installing, running, and testing the compiler.
</p>

<p>
IntelliJ IDEA (Maia release)
<a href="http://blogs.jetbrains.com/idea/2009/07/type-annotations-jsr-308-support/">supports</a>
the Type Annotations (JSR-308) syntax.  Other IDEs (such as Eclipse and
NetBeans) are being updated to support the Type Annotations syntax.
For Eclipse, write an <a
href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> buildfile that compiles your project
using the Type Annotations compiler (and maybe does
<a href="http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/#ant-task">pluggable
type-checking</a> too), then build by running Ant.  Problem markers
will show up in the Eclipse IDE as normal.  (You will lose a few Eclipse
features, such as error checking as you type, until Eclipse's internal
compiler is updated for to support type annotations.)
</p>


<h2 id="installing">Installing the Type Annotations compiler</h2>

<p>
The <b>easiest</b> way to install the Type Annotations compiler, which is sufficient
for most users, is to <a
href="http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/#installation">install
the Checker Framework binary distribution</a>.
</p>

<p>
The remainder of this section gives instructions for installing the Type
Annotations compiler from source.
</p>

<p>
Note that while these instructions install the Type Annotations compiler, you do not
have to make it your default compiler.  For example, you
could use the Type Annotations compiler only for running pluggable type-checkers.
Also, you can use javac's <tt>-target</tt> argument to generate bytecodes
that are compatible with earlier JVMs, so that you can work seamlessly with
colleagues who are using an earlier version of Java.
</p>

<p>
If you use an Apple <b>Macintosh (Mac OS X)</b> computer, you must <a href="#building">build
the compiler from source</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="installing-long">Installing from binary</h3>


<p>
<b>Requirements:</b> These instructions assume that <a
href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> is installed.
If you use an Apple <b>Macintosh</b> computer, you must <a href="#building">build
the compiler from source</a>.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Install a new copy of OpenJDK.  This new installation will be modified
    later (but no other copy of OpenJDK will be modified).  You can
    put the new installation anywhere you want; a common place is in a new
    directory <code>~/jsr308</code>.  We will call that directory
    <tt>$JSR308</tt>.
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
	Download a JDK 7 <a
	href="http://download.java.net/jdk7/binaries/">binary snapshot:
	self-extracting JDK file</a>
	(choose JDK, not JRE or DEBUG, and choose a binary, not a source
	distribution).
      </li>
      <li>
        Follow the installation instructions &mdash; essentially,
	just run the <code>.exe</code>, <code>.sh</code>, or <code>.bin</code>
	file that you downloaded and follow the directions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Optionally set the default version of Java.  (At any time, you can run either the
        default or the non-default version of Java.)
      	<ul>
	  <li>
	For <b>Linux</b>:  
	After installing, your old version of Java remains the default.
        If you wish to make OpenJDK Java 7 the default, then
	set your <code>JAVA_HOME</code> environment variable to the top-level
	directory of the JDK 7 installation <code>/path/to/jdk1.7.0</code>, and
	augment your <code>PATH</code> with
	<code>/path/to/jdk1.7.0/bin</code>.  Example:
<pre>
export JSR308=$HOME/jsr308
export JAVA_HOME=$JSR308/jdk1.7.0
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
</pre>
	The shell uses the <code>PATH</code> variable to locate <code>java</code>,
	while Ant uses <code>JAVA_HOME</code>.
	  </li>
	  <li>
        For <b>Windows</b>:
	After installing, the OpenJDK Java 7 (at <code>c:\Program
	Files\Java\jdk1.7.0\</code>) becomes the default.
	If you wish to retain an older version of Java as the default, then
	do the following:
          <ol>
	    <li>Install Java 7</li>
	    <li>Copy the <tt>jdk1.7.0</tt> and <tt>jre1.7.0</tt> directories from <tt>Program Files\Java\</tt> to the desktop</li>
            <li>Uninstall Java 7</li>
	    <li>Move the <tt>jdk/jre</tt> directories back to <tt>Program Files\Java\</tt></li>
          </ol>
        If you want to be able to run javac from Cygwin, then set
	environment variables as for Linux, above.
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Verify that your installation is correct: run
	<code>javac -version</code>, and the output should be <code>javac
	1.7.0-ea</code>.
      </li>
    </ol>


  </li>
  <li>
    Download the <a href="http://types.cs.washington.edu/jsr308/#Download">Type
    Annotations compiler</a>, and unpack it to create a
    <code>langtools</code> directory.  Do <em>not</em> do this inside the
    JDK 7 installation (directory <code>jdk1.7.0</code>) that you
    downloaded in the preceding step.
    Example commands:
<pre>
mkdir ~/jsr308
cd ~/jsr308
wget http://types.cs.washington.edu/jsr308/current/jsr308-langtools.zip
unzip jsr308-langtools.zip
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Ensure that the <code>JAVA_HOME</code> environment variable points to the
    JDK you wish to patch, then patch your JDK 7 installation by running:
<pre>cd langtools/binary
ant install</pre>
    This step makes a backup copy of <tt>tools.jar</tt> and then
    modifies the original by copying some new <tt>.class</tt> files into it.

    <p>(You shouldn't need to undo this step, but you
    can do so by running <tt>ant uninstall</tt>
    which puts back the original version of the <tt>tools.jar</tt> file.)
    </p>

    <!-- This is only applicable to Windows users. -->
    <p>If you get this error message:</p>
    <!-- This is a made-up error message; this document needs to be updated. -->
<pre>
  c:\jsr308\langtools\binary\build.xml:29: Unable to rename old file (c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0\lib\tools.jar.patched) to new file (c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0\lib\tools.jar)
</pre>
    <p>
    then rename the file manually using the shell.
    (This error occurs under Windows when some other process, such as an anti-virus
    program or another Java process, is accessing the given file.)
    </p>

  </li>
  <li>
    Run
<pre>
javac -version
</pre>
    and confirm that the output contains the
    string <code>jsr308</code>, such as <code>javac 1.7.0-jsr308-0.9.2</code>.
    <br />
    If the output is does not contain <code>jsr308</code> 
    (e.g., <code>javac 1.7.0-ea</code>), but you are using the
    correct <code>javac</code> binary (in <code>langtools/dist/bin</code>), 
    then it is possible that
    <code>tools.jar</code> is on your classpath.  You should either remove
    <code>tools.jar</code> from your classpath, or else put 
    <code>langtools/dist/lib/javac.jar</code> and/or 
    <code>langtools/dist/lib/javap.jar</code>
    on your classpath before <code>tools.jar</code>.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
When updating to a newer version of the Type Annotations compiler, you only have to
follow steps 2, 3, and 4.  In other words, you only have to redo step 1 if
you want a newer version of OpenJDK.
</p>


<h3 id="building">Installing from source</h3>

<p>
To build the Type Annotations compiler from source, replace <a href="#installing-long">step 3 from above</a> by
the following.  Building from source is useful mainly for people who are
developing compiler plug-ins or modifying the compiler itself.  If you only
want to <em>use</em> the compiler and plug-ins, it is sufficient to install
the pre-compiled version.
</p>

<p>
<b>Requirements:</b> These instructions assume that
<!-- Need a version of Ant that supports the nested "condition" element
  inside a <fail> directive.   Version 1.6 (Feb 2004) does not work. -->
<a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> (version 1.7 or later)
and
JDK 6 are installed.  You will use JDK 6 to compile OpenJDK, but will not use it
thereafter.  You can get JDK 6 from
<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">Sun</a> or
elsewhere.  If you use an Apple Macintosh (Mac OS X), then depending on
your hardware and operating system, you can either use <a
href="http://developer.apple.com/java/">Apple's implementation</a> or <a
href="http://landonf.bikemonkey.org/static/soylatte/">SoyLatte</a>.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Set <code>JAVA_HOME</code> environment file to the location of
    your JDK 6 or 7 installation.  Most likely it is already set for
    Ant to work.
  </li>
  <li>
    Compile the Type Annotations javac compiler and the javap tool, from
    directory <code>langtools/make</code>:
<pre>cd langtools/make
ant clean build-javac build-javap</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Add the <code>langtools/dist/bin</code> directory to the front of your
    <code>PATH</code> environment variable.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
The effect of the above commands is that the <code>javac</code>
command invokes the Type Annotations Java compiler and the <code>javap</code>
command invokes the Type Annotations <code>javap</code>, but the Java 7 OpenJDK
is used for everything else.
</p>


<h2 id="differences">Features of the Type Annotations compiler</h2>


<h3 id="jsr308-features">Type Annotations (JSR 308) features</h3>

<p>The new type annotations features (which appear in both OpenJDK and in
  the Type Annotations compiler) are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The compiler (which is located in
    <code>langtools/src/share/classes</code>) supports the Type Annotations
    syntax.  This syntax
    permits annotations to appear on any occurrence of a type, not just on
    declarations as declaration annotation (also known as Java 5
    annoatations or JSR 175 annotations) do.  For details of the syntax,
    see the Type Annotations (JSR 308) specification
    (<a href="http://types.cs.washington.edu/jsr308/specification/java-annotation-design.pdf">PDF</a>,
    <a href="http://types.cs.washington.edu/jsr308/specification/java-annotation-design.html">HTML</a>).</li>
  <li>javac has the ability to warn about redundant casts (when directed to
   do so using a lint option).  If the target type of the cast contains an
   annotation, then javac never issues a redundant cast warning, but leaves
   that up to the annotation processor.  The processor should issue a
   warning exactly if the cast is redundant with respect to the entire
   annotated type:  that is, the unannotated type parts are redundant when
   ignoring the annotations, and the annotations are also redundant.
   (A potential problem is that if a type has multiple annotations that are
   handled by different type processors, then no redundant cast warning
   will ever be issued.)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="openjdk-differences">Differences from the OpenJDK compiler</h3>


<p>The Type Annotations distribution includes only the <code>langtools</code>
portion of OpenJDK. The Type Annotations compiler
makes no modifications in other parts of OpenJDK, and the
remaining parts of OpenJDK are not necessary to build and use the
Type Annotations tools.
</p>

<p>This Type Annotations distribution differs from the <code>langtools</code>
portion of Sun's OpenJDK distribution
in the following ways:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>This documentation file has been included.</li>
  <li>A <tt>doc/</tt> subdirectory contains other design documentation.</li>
  <li>
    The 
    compiler parses annotations written in <a
    href="#annotations-in-comment">specially-formatted comments</a>,
    which enables your code to
    <ul>
      <li>compile with earlier compilers, and</li>
      <li>be type-checked by the Type Annotations compiler. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Sometimes, bug fixes appear in this distribution slightly before they
    are incorporated in the OpenJDK.
</ul>


<h4 id="annotations-in-comment">Writing annotations in comments for forward compatibility</h4>

<p>
The Type Annotations compiler (that is distributed by
researchers at MIT and the University of Washington) allows annotations to
be written in &ldquo;<code>/* */</code>&ldquo; (C-style) comments, for example:
</p>
<pre>
  List&lt;/*@NonNull*/ String&gt; strings;
</pre>
<p>
There must be no whitespace within the comment.
For additional information about this feature, see the
<a href="http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/#annotations-in-comments">Checker
Framework Manual</a>.
</p>

<p>
These mechanism allows developers to use type
annotations while maintaining the ability to compile their code with an
unmodified Java compiler, including compilers for earlier versions of the
Java language (such as Java 4, Java 5, or Java 6).
</p>
 
<p>
A related mechanism, that also facilitates compatibility with compilers
that do not support the Type Annotations syntax, is 
the ability to specify imported packages from the command line.  It is also
documented in the
<a href="http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/#annotations-in-comments">Checker
Framework Manual</a>.
</p>


<!--
<p>
The Java 7 language will not require compilers to support this temporary
mechanism, and Sun's javac compiler will not do so.
</p>
-->

<!--
javac support for the comment syntax may help to transition users gently to
the new Java 7 features.  Java programmers delayed adopting Java 5 (e.g.,
generics), primarily because of backward compatibility issues:  e.g., their
coworkers/boss/customers didn't want to use Java 5.  But if we could give
programmers the benefits of type annotations while not affecting backward
compatibility, that might help more people adopt Java 7 sooner, thus
increasing its momentum.
-->



<h4 id="diffs">Determining a diff against the OpenJDK distribution</h4>

<p>The Type Annotations distribution is a modification of the 
<code>langtools</code> portion of Sun's
<a href="http://openjdk.java.net/">OpenJDK</a>
<code>javac</code> distribution.

<p>The following commands determine the differences between the Type Annotations compiler and the OpenJDK compiler.

<ol>
  <li>If you do not have a clean checkout of the Type Annotations compiler source,
  obtain one:

  <pre><code>
  hg clone https://jsr308-langtools.googlecode.com/hg/ jsr308-langtools
  </code></pre>

  If you already have one, then just pull all the changes, by running the
  following command in the directory containing the Type Annotations
  compiler source:
  <pre><code>
  hg pull; hg up
  </code></pre>
  </li>
  
  <li>Determine the identifier of the last changeset done by Sun.  Run
  "<code>hg log | less</code>" to find the last changeset with an author
  other than <code>mali</code> or <code>mernst</code>.  The changeset
  identifier would be in format of:
  <pre><code>
  450:143956db282e
  </code></pre>
  </li>
  
  <li> Use <code>hg diff</code> to generate the diff.
  <pre><code>
    hg diff -r450:tip
  </code></pre>
</ol>


<h2 id="Contributing">Contributing</h2>

<p>
We welcome bug fixes, new features, type-checking plug-ins, and other
improvements.
All contributions to <code>javac</code> (annotation-related or not) should follow the
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/ahe/entry/contributing_to_javac">guidelines
for contributing to javac</a>.
Any code contributed to javac or to the Type Annotations compiler is
contributed to Sun under Sun's Contributor Agreement
(<a href="http://openjdk.java.net/contribute/">SCA</a>).
</p>


<h3 id="reporting-bugs">How to report bugs</h3>

<p>
To report a bug, use the
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/jsr308-langtools/issues/list">issue
  tracking system</a>.<br/>
Please see below for details that will help you submit an informative bug
report, that is most likely to be accepted.
</p>


<h4>What bugs should you report?</h4> <!-- omit from toc -->

<p>
If you have any problems with the compiler, please let us know.
We welcome bug reports and suggestions, and we want to help.
We will fix all reported bugs in the Type Annotations compiler.
Examples of bugs include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Any inconsistency between the Type Annotations compiler and the
      JSR 308 design (<a
href="http://types.cs.washington.edu/jsr308/specification/java-annotation-design.pdf">PDF</a>,
<a href="http://types.cs.washington.edu/jsr308/specification/java-annotation-design.html">HTML</a>).
  </li>
  <li>Any annotation-related problem.
  </li>
  <li>Any problem that occurs with the Type Annotations compiler but does not occur
      with the OpenJDK Java 7 compiler on which the Type Annotations compiler is based.
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>To whom should you report the bug?</h4> <!-- omit from toc -->

<p>
The Type Annotations compiler is built on Sun's OpenJDK compiler.  If you find a bug
in the Type Annotations compiler:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>It might be due to a bug in the OpenJDK compiler.
      In this case, it should be reported to Sun.
  </li>
  <li>It might be due to the Type Annotations modifications.
      In this case, it should be reported to the Type Annotations compiler
      developers.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
In some cases (such as a problem with processing
annotations on types), the responsibility is clearly with the JSR 308
modifications.  Otherwise, please determine who is responsible for the bug
using this procedure:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Obtain a copy of Mercurial reversion <!-- revision -->72<!-- /revision --> of
  the OpenJDK compiler, using the commands in the <a href="#diffs">diff
  section</a> of this document.</li>
  <li>Try your test case using the
  OpenJDK compiler.  If the problem is present, then search the
  <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/index.jsp">bug database</a> (use
  the &ldquo;Java&rdquo; category).  If the problem is not in the bug database, then
  <a href="http://bugreport.sun.com/bugreport/index.jsp">report your
  bug to Sun</a>, using category &ldquo;Java&rdquo;
  and subcategory &ldquo;compiler&rdquo;.
  </li>
</ol>



<p>
If the problem is present in the Type Annotations compiler, but not in the OpenJDK
compiler, then please report it to us by creating a new issue in the
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/jsr308-langtools/issues/list">issue tracking system</a>.
(Search the issue tracker first, to avoid reporting a duplicate.  But feel
free to augment an existing issue with more information.)
The issue tracker is not intended for general support or questions.
</p>


<h4>How can you make a clear, complete bug report?</h4> <!-- omit from toc -->

<p>
Please ensure that your bug report is clear and that it is complete.
Otherwise, we may be unable to understand it or to reproduce it, either of
which would prevent us from fixing the bug.  Sun has a description of
<a
href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/bugreport_howto/index.html">how
to write a helpful bug report</a>.  Here are some crucial points:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Indicate exactly what you did.  Show the exact commands (don't merely
      describe them in words).  Don't skip any steps.
  </li>
  <li>Include all files that are necessary to reproduce the problem.  This
      includes every file that is used by any of the commands you reported, and
      possibly other files as well.
  </li>
  <li>Indicate exactly what the result was (don't merely describe it in
      words).
      Also indicate what you expected the result to be &mdash; remember,
      a bug is a difference between desired and actual outcomes.
  </li>
  <li>Indicate which version of the Type Annotations compiler you are using.
      You can determine that by running <code>javac -version</code>.
  </li>
</ul>
